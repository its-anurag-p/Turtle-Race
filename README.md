A randomly simulated turtle race! You can watch different color turtles race across the screen and a random turrtle wins the race.

After the code simulates a turtle race with multiple participants it also tracks the winners, and maintains a scorecard in a file named "scores.txt". It allows the user to play the game multiple times.
